# Placement: 1st

# Idea
    Homework Reminder Service for students

# Features To Implement

- [x] Create Backend Python REST API
- [x] Create a python script to email and text a user about due assignments
- [x] Front end web application

# Details
We created a reminder service in python so that students could sign up for text message and email reminders to do their homework. We also made a sign in dashboard so that students could visualize their upcoming assignments.

We created a Flask REST API in python so that our front-end application only recieved the information we wanted it to. 

We also interacted with the Canvas LMS REST API to get the information we needed.
